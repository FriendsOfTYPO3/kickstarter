Extension Kickstarter
=====================

The **Extension Kickstarter (kickstarter)** is a tool that helps you to
quickly create your own TYPO3 extensions. It provides a basic framework and
templates. It has been designed to help you work more productively. This tool
comes with a set of commands that can be used to create different parts of an
extension, such as controllers, models, repositories, services and
configurations.

Using the provided commands, you can make your development workflow much more
efficient by automating repetitive tasks, improving consistency, and following
TYPO3 best practices. This makes it easier for both beginners and experienced
developers to build strong and customised TYPO3 extensions efficiently.

To get started, read the sections below to learn how to install, configure,
