Configuration
=============

In extension settings (Install Tool) you will find just one option:

exportDirectory
===============

If empty, your created extensions will be exported to
`[TYPO3 temp. dir]/ext-kickstarter/*` by default. I prefer to set this
directory to `packages/`. That's the default import directory for local
available packages.

This setting can not be set via CLI usage.
