# TYPO3 Extension Kickstarter

`kickstarter` is a TYPO3 extension that simplifies and accelerates the creation of new TYPO3 extensions by automating file generation, controller setup, and plugin registration through easy-to-use CLI commands. With a few CLI commands, it generates essential files like `LICENSE`, `ext_emconf.php`,`composer.json`, and more.

## Configuration

By default, new extensions are created in `typo3temp/kickstarter/[your_ext_key]`.

To change this location:

- Navigate to **TYPO3 Backend → Admin Tools → Settings → Configure Extensions → `kickstarter`**.
- For Composer-based installations, the recommended directory is `packages/`.
